# Fostr
Lot's of animals are in need of good owners and we're here to help them find a good home. Fostr is an intuitive app that will get you connected with pets and their foster carers. You can then chat with the foster carer to learn more about the precious animals and decide if you want to meet up at the foster home and see how you connect with the pet you chose.

This gives you the ease of finding foster pets from multiple foster homes in the comfort of your own home!
